  This will search a numeric matrix for specific values.

  Where
  data to find --- scalar/vector/matrix of values to find
  where to find it --- vector/matrix to search
  return type --- 1:logical array indicating success or failure; 0: array
    indicating number of occurances
  search results --- array of same size as data to find with results

  Example: d = unidrnd(10,10,1), ISIN([2,5],d,0)
