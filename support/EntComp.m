function C1 = EntComp(sqmat,IFIM)
%{ complexity = EntComp(square matrix, type switch)
 Calculate the C1 or C1f Entropic Complexity Measure of a matrix 
  (presumably covariance matrix) from multivariate data.

  Where
  square matrix --- (pxp) covariance matrix for analysis
  type switch --- Scalar indicating how to do computation:
     1 = compute C1 complexity of matrix; 0 = compute complexity
     of IFIM depending on sigma and Dp by opening it up; -1 = compute C1F
     frobenius norm version complexity of matrix
  complexity --- Scalar complexity of the provided matrix

  Example: c1 = EntComp(randn(4),1)
