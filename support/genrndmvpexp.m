function X = genrndmvpexp(n,p,Mu,Sigma,Beta,plotflg)
%{ rands = genrndmvpexp(n,p,Mu,Sigma,Beta,scatter plot)
  Returns a sample matrix from multivariate Power Exponential distribution
  with a given mean vector, covariance matrix, and kurtosis parameter. For
  repeatability, the states for both randn and rand must be set.

  Where
  n --- scalar number of sample sets to be generated
  p --- scalar number of variables
  Mu --- (px1) mean vector
  Sigma --- (pxp) covariance matrix
  Beta --- scalar kurtosis parameter of PE distribution
  scatter plot --- 1 = make scatter plot, 0 (default) = don't
  rands --- (nxp) matrix of random data

  Example: pexp = genrndmvpexp(500,2,[0;0],[1,0;0,1],2,1);
