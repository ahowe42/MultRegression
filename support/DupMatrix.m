function [Dp,mopeninv] = DupMatrix(p)
%{
  [dupmat, mopeninv] = DupMatrix(number dimensions)

  Returns Magnus and Neudecker's duplication matrix of size p, and the
  moore-penrose inverse of Dp - Dp+.

  Where
  number dimensions  --- scalar integer p
  dupmat --- (p^2 x 0.5*p*(p+1)) duplication matrix
  mopeninv --- moore-penrose inverse of duplication matrix

  [Dp,mopeninv] = DupMatrix(2)
