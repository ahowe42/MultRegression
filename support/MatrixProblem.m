function probcode = MatrixProblem(sqmat,printmess,rclim)
%{ problem code = MatrixProblem(square matrix, print message, rcond limit)
  This function will take in a square, presumably covariance, matrix and
  evaluate it for ill-conditionedness and positive definitedness, in that
  order.

  Where
  square matrix --- Square matrix to be evaluated.
  print message --- Optional logical, if 1, this will print a message.
  rcond limit --- Optional, smallest reciprocal condition number to still
   be considered ok; default is 1e-10.
  problem code --- 0 = no problem; 1 = ill-conditioned;  2 = not positive definite

  Example: MatrixProblem(rand(4),1)
